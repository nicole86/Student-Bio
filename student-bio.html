		   <p> In 2003, I decided to move from Singapore to the US in search for a new experience and better opportunities. I attended Fairleigh Dickinson University and graduated with a Communications degree, however, because of the economic landscape, I was not able to find what I was looking for in a career. Therefore, I have recently changed directions and began pursuing a career in computer programming.
